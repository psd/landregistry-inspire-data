Land Registry INSPIRE Index Polygons Service – conditions of use v2
Your use of the Land Registry INSPIRE Index Polygons service is governed by these conditions.
Subject to the paragraphs below, the INSPIRE Index polygons and attributes provided in this service are available for use and re-use under the Open Government Licence (OGL). This licence enables public bodies to make their data freely available for re-use.
Use under the OGL is free. If you fail to comply with any of the conditions of the OGL then the rights granted to you under the licence will end automatically.
Under the OGL, when reusing the data, you must acknowledge the source of the data and include an attribution statement. Therefore, you must:
(a) display the following statement: ‘This information is subject to Crown copyright and is reproduced with the permission of Land Registry’;
(b) in addition to (a), when reusing the polygons (including the associated geometry, namely x,y co-ordinates), display the following Ordnance Survey copyright/database right notice: ‘© Crown copyright and database rights [year of supply or date of publication] Ordnance Survey 100026316’; and
(c) where possible, provide a link to these conditions.
Under the OGL, Land Registry permits you to use the data for commercial or non- commercial purposes. However, as the licence says, OGL does not cover the use of third party rights which we are not authorised to license. Land Registry uses Ordnance Survey data in the preparation of the polygons and therefore you should contact Ordnance Survey [link] for the relevant licence conditions if you require to:
(a) use the polygons (including the associated geometry, namely x,y co-ordinates) for a purpose other than personal, non-commercial use or commercial or non-commercial use within your organisation; or
(b) sub-license, distribute, sell or make available the polygons (including the associated geometry, namely x,y co-ordinates) to third parties.
